The RAYMASTER 5000

Provided are the project files to run the raytracer. If not using Mac OS X, compilers might complain about some type values, (float literals in c++ in windows environments sometimes necessitate the 'f'), but otherwise it's cross platform compatible.

I have provided an example scene, "example.scene" for testing purposes.

TODO List:
* <strike>Add in general quadrics.</strike>
* <strike>Change to a Scene paradigm, with multiple cameras possible</strike>
* <strike>Rewrite filehandler and convert scenes to xml</strike>
* <b>Settle on the correct z-depth before getting shape's color</b>
* <b>Ditch OpenGL for a simple PNG writer</b>
* Clean up naming conventions
* Document all of the code, not just the critical parts
* Add finite shapes / unions and subtractions
* Add subdivision surfaces
