The RAYMASTER

Provided are the project files to run the raytracer. If not using Mac OS X, compilers might complain about some type values, (float literals in c++ in windows environments sometimes necessitate the 'f'), but otherwise it's cross platform compatible.

I have provided an example scene, "example.scene" for testing purposes.

TODO List:
1. Ditch OpenGL for a simple PNG writer.
2. Add in general quadrics.
3. Clean up naming conventions.
4. Document all of the code, not just the critical parts.
5. Rewrite filehandler and convert scenes to xml
6. Add finite shapes
7. Add unions and subtractions
8. Add subdivision surfaces
